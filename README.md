# drainage-pattern-analysis

## Assignment

  Basic functionality: You are provided with a ‘DTM’ file dtm50.txt, which represents digital terrain model data (heights) at 50m intervals over a 10km x 10km square of hilly terrain in Scotland. The values are space-separated (not comma separated), and are in logical order (so the each row is 200 heights above sea level, in meters, from west to east, and rows are arranged from north to south. The data is visualised on the right as a greyscale image, where white is high and dark is low. Write a program that treats this area as a 200 x 200 grid of squares, each with a height obtained from the DTM data, and uses this to analyse which squares are likely to experience relatively high and relatively low waterflow. Use a simple waterflow model, where rainfall is evenly distributed across the area, and water always moves from one square to the lowest adjacent square (so always moves North, South, East or West). To simulate what happens to rain falling on any particular square, determine its path by repeatedly tracking its movement downhill, until it moves into a square on the edge of the grid (where you cannot calculate flow direction properly). If there are two equally low possible directions, your simulation should choose one at random. Your simulation will also need to make sure that the path cannot visit the same square twice, or find some other way to make sure that it cannot get into a ‘loop’. Your program will need to keep track of how many of these ‘water paths’ pass through each square to assess its relative waterflow.
